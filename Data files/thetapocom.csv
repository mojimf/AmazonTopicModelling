  This phone performance is above average not good. Sometimes phones gets stuck and it happens once in around 15 days. One good thing about this phone is screen. And battery life is not that good. Coming to processor when we play games like pubg and other high end games this phones strucks frequently and not feasible. Back camera is good but front camera is not at all satisfactory. Overall product is above average.

  The phone is awesome . The camera , battery life and everything in the phone is par at performance. If your budget is under or upto 10K you can blindly go for it. I have Benn using this phone for 4 months and it had never hanged once and everything is going very smooth. And the miui updates are always availed within time and soon mi will provide android 10 update for this set.

  A product which is excellent for the price it is at. Amother class creation from the 1 + stable ! Totally money's worth. Features are brilliant. However was left a bit disappointed when I discovered, it's only 1 sim phone and for head sets / earphones one has to order the earphones cable as the port has not been given. Overall the phone is really good.

  Yes redmi gives a lot of specs in 10k pricing and it's quite good experience , camera is not bad but it's not that great either don't expect iPhone quality Cam ,even if it has quad cam it's just normal camera quality.Processor is not Great for gaming it heats up after half hour of Pubg."

  What's up Video calling is not possible in the begining but after one month it support what's up vdo cllng and the battery performance is well and fingerprinting is also well back camara is good and only one lens is working in the camara  remaining two are just to blame customers and selfi camara is not up to mark but manageable . Mobile data also working smoothly in this mobile and negligible heating issue we can see in the mobile while charging as well as gaming and at the time of data usage..."

  Been using it for 2 weeks now.... The battery is good and lasts for a day with moderate usage. There is no display tint issue as said by many users. The camera quality is however a bit low compared to other flagship models.. the colour saturation in camera is low comparatively with my OnePlus 7. But overall it's worth the money. Certain features could improve with updates like camera.

  I have been using redmi phones for a while now. What I love about this phone is its camera and it's finish. Been about two days so phone is still very fast and smooth. Got the 6gb version and lag is minimal. The 48Mp camera actually has minimal lag and the 2x telephoto mode works very well. Happy with my purchase

  Already being associated with MI family, i once again decided to upgrade my MI phone by buying Redmi Note 8. The quad camera gives extremely good quality photoshoots. It also have a macro mode where objects can be focused which are extremely close to the camera.  The phone is quite fast and every applications run smoothly in it. The battery life is good. The charger given in box is a quick charger. Overall, this phone is value for money."

  im using the device since 20 days and my review for the device.Great value for money product with having a good mid range processor. 90 Hz fluid amoled display gives smoother experience. camera was awesome at the price point and believed to be software update for camera for more crisp camera quality...in love with OnePlus oxygen ui..

  Best feature phone within 13,000. Decent battery back up and charging speed. Not advisable for gaming. Try note 8 pro (4,500 mah battery) if you want to play High end games. It also has 3.5 mm headphone jack, so you don't have to throw away your earphones. Smooth touch and good processing speed."

  One of the best budget phone i ever used. I bought it on December 2019 @9999/- INR. The only problem with it was its battery backup. I had to charge twice a day. Which doesn't suit for me & so i changed the phone in June 2020. Rest all specs were excellent at that price point.

  It's a very nice smartphone. Camera quality is great, gives crisp and lovely pictures. Better than any other phone I have used till date. Battery charging is just unbelievable. Charges at around 11% every 5 minutes. 100% done in just over 45-50 minutes. Though till date, I have never charged beyond 95%. Do occasionally peek into the OnePlus community to see how others are doing. I am sure no one is unhappy with this product. I am certainly not !!!!

  The redmi note 8 is a good phone for this price... Because the main specialty is it's colour.. And the front camera and back cameras are good.. But the processing is speed is law.. And the heating capacity for the phone is less. It has all quad camera and we can use this camera for wide length photography

The camera is decent and video recording is superb infact the pro videomode with focus peaking makes vlogging experience decent. Also the Snapdragon 720G is powerfull enough to get all your work summed up! It runs PUBG With Smooth And Ultra ,Balanced and ultra, Hd and high framerate.."

  OnePlus nord is definitely overhyped to the next level , but the price is good and it is not the best OnePlus device nowhere near oneplus8 camera is the weakest point the third camera for the Bokeh mode is not even used when you hide the third camera and click on portrait mode of the picture quality is still the same , if you have no problem with camera go for it , or increase your budget and go for oneplus8, overall it's  a decent phone

  Dislikes : I dint like the seller experience while placing the order. I placed the order on 25th Aug and item was supposed to get delivered on 30th Aug however the seller dint dispatch the order till Friday and then the delivery date got changed to 2nd Sep. Seller was unresponsive and dint respond to the email. Very bad service . Though i received the product on 2nd but i never expected this kind of overall service by Amazon."

  Overall the user experience of the phone is good. The display is impressive, 60 hz refresh rate make everything smooth... The processor is good and it's quite fast. It gives a feel of almost a flagship. Only area of concern is average quality low light photography. But I think for  a phone under 30k..it's can be ignored."

  I’ve bought 3 Redmi Note 8 from Amazon and last 2 were absolutely perfect but the last one is defective and there are 3 major problem with this device. After using 7 days I’ve called Amazon to replace this defective device but they are making excuses and trying to keep using this device.  Also they told me to calibrate battery which is not last long for 1 day but the major problem is front Selfie camera."

  One plus never fails to surprise. I purchased this phone for my mother who has always been a samsung user. Initially she took a while to adjust but now she is in love. The battery life and camera quality are the cherry on top of a beautiful cake. Overall the phone delivers and lives upto the one plus standards. It is fairly priced and does not burn a whole in one's pocket."

  This Redmi Note 8 looks very rich because of glass finish and reflective colour back. Very strong and tough material. Fits good in hands; Bit heavy though. Ease and accesibility options at full screen mode. Touch is accurate. Screen brightness is little too much. Battery discharge is ok. Performance is more than enough for daily use. Macro mode zooming and wide mode are good. '48MP' camera is just like any other 12MP camera."
