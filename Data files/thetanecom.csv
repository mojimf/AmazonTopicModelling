  there was a tint on screen along camera module which is visible in low brightness, technician admitted that it was a manufacturing defect but amazon refused to give me a replacement, oneplus customer care suggested me to visit service center for a newly purchased device that is worth 30k. if these things happen in budget phones, it's okay but it's a premium midrange smartphone and that too from a reputed brand. checked oneplus forums and saw lots of users are facing same issue, in my suggestion. don't buy this product because amazon is not going to help you with this product after sale. even oneplus is not going to help you with this, the statement i recieved was that is a characterstic of OLED display, while me being using amoled screens from last 4 years, knows that it's not a characterstic feature but a manufacturing defect. not the brand which stands for quality anymore.

  The phone was hyped so much that I decided not to wait and pre-book the device but to my utter dismay the day I received the device I noticed that the screen on dim brightness started flickering a bit upon which I raised the issue with Amazon, I thought that it was just some minor issue which the influencers were talking about and might get rectified with a software update. The update did happened but the issue still remained but it didn't stop there, to add insult to injury the phone automatically got formatted and all my data got lost! I literally rued my decision of ordering the phone in a hurry.

  This is my first OnePlus phone. I was expecting a lot at this price. Everything is good about this phone but the camera is not good. Not at all good. I was using motrola and oppo f7 previously their camera quality is far better than nord. I made a big mistake exchanging my oppo f7. In nord pictures arevlike just as clicked by an ordinary camera. Pixels scattered. So if you are looking for a good camera phone don't go for it. I tried to return it to Amazon but they don't have any return policy for electronic items. So I am a totally disappointed with my decision of buying NORD. It should be priced not more than 18000-2000

  side & Bottom border area keyboard keys are not working properly, like p, q, capslock, backspace, '?123', navigation keys like back, home etc. Sometimes they work sometimes they don't, it's very irritating when you have to correct spelling by deleting the misspelt word due to miss of the letter. At least 3 out of 10 hits are missing regularly. In addition to it, voice during the call is leaking in the earpiece, it's like I am hearing my own voice while talking. Poor feeling. Otherwise, the phone is working fine. Didn't expect this from such a brand. Really disappointed"

  The apps are automatically opening and closing and all the applications are themselves opening. I have visited the service centre twice but still the problem exist. I would not reccomend anyone to buy this phone and also the Radiant MI service centre is the worst service centre who don't even giving proper response to the customer. The service centre is degrading the reputation of MI company.

So many times Restarted eventhough no response. And phone also strucking while using."

I have a galaxy s8 plus too and seen samsung service centres.The service offered from Redmi is very bad. They dont care at all...!!

  The one plus is still not ready to address the tint issue. It is kind for pretty much annoying the display will be turned to pink and green. The one plus community says that its a property of amoled,which i didnt find in any of the samsung devices. If you are still going for this phone then make sure that you are ready to live with this aweful display. As i dont think that they are going to do anything about it. Cheers.

  First of all, this device is hyped with hell lot of expectations. Amzed with the features offered, I Pre-ordered Oneplus nord and waited 9 days for the delivery. After switching on my device, I just have no words by seeing the yellowish tint on the display. This is even more worse using in night times with green and purple tints at low brightness levels. My oneplus 3T display looks much better compared to the Nord. The replacement is processed by Amazon as they verify issue by arranging technician visit to examine my device first. It's really a big disappointment..Thanks to Amazon for looking into my issue .. I suggest ppl to reconsider before buying.

  One plus Nord is not worth even  Rs.15000/- .After setting up the mobile, it was found that Power button is not working & mobile is not switching off. The display is becoming dim on its own & phone is heating up like hot cake & draining the bettery quickly.

  Dont fall in trap. According to one plus, this phone has a new feature ""pink tint in display"" after knowing that it was a feature, I was so grateful. So no replacement should be given on the behalf of that feature..I am lucky among my friends to have this feature who bought this device..Thankyou one plus for the splendid feature you have given for some devices.

I feel that iff i use it in the night my eyes will get spoilt because the red hue is very annoying. Disappointed by one plus, didn't expect cheap product like this."

  It's amazing & disheartening that One Plus Nord is unworthy of its price. Pictures taken with the phone shows green tint. The icons are more or less yellow in color. Red colored Icons are deep brown. When keyboards are used the Emojies are yellow in color. Find no ways to correct these problems. You should have the option of return. It""s really wastage of money for a retired person of 74 years old.

  The phone got hung up while an incoming call was done. The entire screen got black. Could not do the operation to recieve the incoming call. This happened thrice within two weeks of purchase. Seems some defect in the phone. Did not expect such a bad product from Redmi . I m a regular user of redmi phone. My earlier redmi note 5 pro is working fine for last two years and no such issue with my earlier phone. Redmi needs to ramp up the quality of their mobiles. seems they are compromising on quality after achieving success on the brand earlier. This is not good. Shame on redmi for fooling customers.

  Below average image quality. Selfies come with a halo around the head. Looks photopshopped. Disappointment! Do not buy if you want even a decent camera. Phones in half the price are offering better cameras as per my personal experience. Battery is alright (lasts 24 hours with moderate use and insta browsing. Doubt it will last long if you use it for gaming).

  The phone keeps on getting hanged frequently. It's been hardly one month that I have bought the phone. Please recommend what can be done. It's very horrible as it causes so maby problems. 3-4 times I have to restart the phone in one day. I didn't know redmi is going to fool me by launching such a pathetic phone which functions properly for hardly a week.
